# Summary
Muffle sounds from other players during activities like woodcutting and mining which often overlap and compound sounds to unbearable levels. For the individual that still wnats to hear their own player chopping or mining, and not have their ears blown out by their comrades.

# Update
Archiving this since it was brought to my attention that this functionality already existed in the seemingly only place I hadn't looked. The "Music" plugin native to Runelite has a build in "Disable other player's area sounds" option which I never noticed since I didn't think it'd be in a plugin called "Music".
